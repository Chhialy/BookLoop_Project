# Mobile (Flutter) — BookLoop Project

This folder contains a minimal Flutter scaffold for implementing the 11 Figma designs.

Quick start (local machine must have the Flutter SDK installed):

1. Install Flutter: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. From repo root:

```powershell
cd 'C:\Users\chhia\OneDrive\Desktop\BookLoop_Project\mobile\flutter'
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Notes:
- On Windows you can run Android emulators locally. For iOS builds/simulator you need macOS or a cloud builder.
- Design assets and tokens should be added to `assets/` and `lib/design_tokens.dart`.
- Replace the placeholder screens in `lib/screens/` with real implementations after you export assets from Figma.
